# ⚡ About Django Blog Website
I made this application with the help of this youtube series: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmljXZIypDc&list=PL-osiE80TeTtoQCKZ03TU5fNfx2UY6U4p

### Key features 
- Create blogs
- Manage users via admin panel
- Authentication and authorization
- Edit blogs etc.

# ✨ My additions 
- My additions include hosting the database using Railway and the entire website, also using Railway.
- Also, I have followed the Django official website tutorial on creating the polls app which I also used in this website.
Basically, I have linked those two together to make this application. 
- Some functionallities I have added include allowing only the logged in users to vote and they can vote only once, and I have made some links to the home page to 
those polls. I have made it so that only the last poll published by the admin can be seen in the home page. 

# 🚀 Build

You would maybe like to use sqlite for your local deployment, so look up sqlite database settings for django before deploying.
You should modify the settings.py file, and then you can:
```
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```
