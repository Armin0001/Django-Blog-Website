<h1 align="center"> Django Blog Website </h1>

# About Django Blog Website
I made this application with the help of this youtube series: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmljXZIypDc&list=PL-osiE80TeTtoQCKZ03TU5fNfx2UY6U4p
- Create Blogs
- Manage users via admin panel
- Authentication and authorization
- Edit blogs etc.

# My additions 
- My additions include hosting the database using Railway and the entire website, also using Railway.
- Also, I have followed the Django official website tutorial on creating the polls app which I also used in this website.
Basically, I have linked those two together to make this application. I have provided the link to check out the website below so you can see.
- Some functionallities I have added include allowing only the logged in users to vote and they can vote only once, and I have made some links to the home page to 
those polls. I have made it so that only the last poll published by the admin can be seen in the home page. 

# ðŸš€ Build
